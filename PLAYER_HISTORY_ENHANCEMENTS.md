## UI Changes

### Tournament History Card
**Before:**
```
Tournament Name
Year - Course Name
Gross: X | Net: Y | Stableford: Z
```

**After:**
```
Tournament Name [1st of 12]  ← Position badge
Year - Course Name
Gross: X | Net: Y | Stableford: Z
[View Scorecard] ← New button
```

### Position Badge Colors
- 1st place: Gold background with dark gold text
- 2nd place: Silver/Gray background
- 3rd place: Bronze/Orange background
- Other: Blue background with dark blue text

## Technical Implementation

### New State
```javascript
const [viewingScorecard, setViewingScorecard] = useState(null);
```

### New Helper Function
```javascript
const getOrdinal = (n) => {
  // Converts numbers to ordinal: 1 → "1st", 2 → "2nd", 3 → "3rd", etc.
  const s = ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd'];
  const v = n % 100;
  return n + (s[(v - 20) % 10] || s[v] || s[0]);
};
```

### Data Structure Enhancement
Each tournament in player history now includes:
```javascript
{
  tournament: {...},
  grossTotal: number,
  netTotal: number,
  stablefordTotal: number,
  playerScores: { hole: strokes },  // Added for scorecard
  hasScores: boolean,
  position: number,                  // Added: 1, 2, 3, etc.
  totalPlayers: number              // Added: Total competitors
}
```

### Position Calculation Algorithm
1. Get all players' scores for the tournament
2. Calculate each player's net score (gross - handicap)
3. Filter out players with no scores
4. Sort by net score (ascending - lower is better)
5. Find selected player's index in sorted list
6. Position = index + 1

### Scorecard Modal Structure
